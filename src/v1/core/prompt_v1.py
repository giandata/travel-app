 In case the starting country is included in countries to visit ({selected_countries}) 
 and the number of countries is higher than the number of days ({duration}), you can skip the visits in the starting country. 
 The travel has to start on the provided departure date: {date}.

 Balance the activity quantity and quality by using the travel budget of {price_range}, feel free to go as above as necessary in the budget to reach the number of days of the travel.
 Optimize the route by minimizing time and travel distance having geopgraphical cognition of Europe.

 Not all the provided countries {selected_countries} have to be necessarily touched in the order they are provided.
