        # The travel can have up to 5 destination countries: {selected_countries}
        # If some countries are not realistically reachable in a reasonable time considering the duration of the travel ({duration}),
        # skip the irrealistic countries and optimize the other provided countries. 

        # In case the selected_country starting countru is included in countries to visit ({selected_countries}) and the numebr of counties is higher than the number of days ({duration}), you can skip the visits in the starting country. 
        # The travel neeeds to start on the provided departure date: {date}.

        # Suggest a plan for the duration of {duration} days.
        # Feel free to explore 1 day longer travels, but make the customer aware of it.
        # Optimize the route by minimizing time and travel distance having geopgraphical cognition of Europe.

        # Not all the provided countries {selected_countries} have to be necessarily touched as for the order they are provided.
        # Organize them in an order that minimizes travel distances, especialy recursive trajectories.
        # In the planning account for the travel distance in your recommendations making only realistic proposals.
        # After you have optimized the route proceed with providing the recommended transportation options.
        # If you skip any of the selected countries explainin the output why it was skipped, if for distance or time, and suggest how to make it possible to touch all the countires.

        # No more than 2 cities of the same country can be touched in a single day.
        # If the preference of having free time is selected ({prefe1}) reduce the amount of visits during the day.
        # When travels include less countries to visit than days of travel, you can propose 2 day in the same location or same country.

        # Try to suggest train transfer if you move internally in a country. 
        # Flights are convenient in the beginnning and end of the travel.
        # If the preference of travelling by night is provided ({prefe2}) try to find night transportation like Nightjets across europe.
        # You can find the cities with Night jet inside {night_jets}.
        # If at least 2 of the selected countries match the countries (keys) of the night jet dictionary {night_jets} try to suggest the linking night train.

        # After optimizing the route, if the price range  is not provided feel free to explore as if there are no budget constrains.
        # If the price range is provided ({price_range}) use it as a context to filter or include more or less expensive activities or visits.

        # After optimizing the route consider the requested travel type ({travel_type}) to find places, monuments, events, restaurants, sights to visit.
        # The places you will propose must be in line with the provided optimizing the route {travel_type} but you can propose something not related to the travel type {travel_type} if it is worth visiting or it has high customer reviews.
        # You can as well give a couple of exclusive options if you have several choices.
        # If the preference of visiting only the center is provided ({prefe3}) try to suggest relevant activities.
        # You can also propose a different number of activities in each day, when travels consist of several days.
        # In bigger cities you can propose more activities than in smaller cities.                    
        # Take into account the season of the travel from the date {date} to calibrate results, prefering indoor activities for fall and winter seasons, and outdoor activities for spring and summer travels.
        
        # When you have a planned travel, prepare the output.
        # Start the travel plan with a phrase of accomplishment in finding a plan and print in **bold characters** a brief title that describes the travel.
        # Give the itinerary resume after the title, including major visits.
        # Every day should appear as a subtitle.
        # For each place or step you propose, give a very short description of it.
        # Provide an estimated cost for every day of travel, and if possible for each activity proposed.
        # Provide an estimate of the transfer duration and cost if possible.
        # Structure the response in bullet points.
